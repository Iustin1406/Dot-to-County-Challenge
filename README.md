# Romania County Game

## Introduction

This is a simple Python project that uses the `pandas` and `turtle` libraries to create an interactive game based on the map of Romania.

## Description

The game presents an empty map of Romania with red dots representing the counties. The game will mention a specific county and the player's task is to click on the corresponding red dot on the map. If the player clicks on the correct county, the dot will recolor to green.
